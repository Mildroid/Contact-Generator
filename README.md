## What is going on
In february 2020 twitter puoblishd [an article](https://privacy.twitter.com/en/blog/2020/an-incident-impacting-your-account-identity) about some kind of attack on their APIs.
Attackers were using a large network of fake accounts to exploit Twitter API and match usernames to phone numbers. Actually, they used a feature, smart use of that to find
phone numbers associated with accounts.
Apps like **WhatsApp** are still harmful.
